TAKEAWAY - please be mindful about how you talk about #depression bc it influences #stigma and how ppl cope with depression    If you're a #journalist or #press #outlet   please consider how the framing of #mentalhealth conditions influence the public's attitudes!,Sad
-Many said #depression is  #not a weakness    **which is accurate :)  -However  only 15% of videos said any good things about having depression   **dep sucks  but the experience can lead to insight for some (7/x),Sad
-Most videos said depression was #treatable   **which is an accurate message :)   -Most said #depression lasts for years   **not always the case  about 50% of ppl can recover in 6 months (6/x),Sad
Results:  -Most videos presented #depression as caused by *either biological or environmental factors   **even though a biopsychosocial is endorsed by clinicians/researchers  -Most presented dep as a category   **even though many types and variants of depression exist (5/x),Sad
These types of health messages about #depression are everywhere   but  until now  we didn't know to what extent   or how much they varied     Our Study: We coded 327 #YouTube videos to understand what types of messages about depression were in the public sphere (4/x),Sad
Another Ex:  If we frame #depression as a  biological disease   ppl w  depression may infer that only antidepressants can help   even though many other treatments -- therapy/exercise/social support -- can *also help  (3/x),Sad
Premise: How we talk about #mentalhealth impacts stigma and help-seeking behaviors  Ex: if we frame #depression as a  chronic disease  in which ppl are  different   there's evidence that ppl might actually stigmatize ppl w  depression more  (2/x),Sad
#depression is hard even without a pandemic  When you understand that the people that are supposed to protect you aren‚Äôt interested in doing that  depression is worse  I feel like I‚Äôve fallen from a hole into a crater  Not from staying home  from lack of confidence in leaders ,Sad

this study showed really clearly that circ rhythms and #depression are very closely linked  and this is measurable  i e  the fatigue is not 'in your head' - your genes are actually dysregulated  7/13,Sad
mounting evidence is suggesting the link is causal  my favourite study on this (https://t co/yhTcSdsBH1) showed in healthy adults  time of death could be predicted ¬± couple hours  in those w #depression  it could not be (based on gene expression) 6/13,Sad
so we know #depression &amp  sleep/fatigue are closely related  circadian rhythms regulate our sleep  &amp  these are regulated primarily by CLOCK genes    to my knowledge (pls correct if iv missed something) we dont yet know (a) the direction  (b) the causality of this relationship 4/13,Sad
in #depression (and other #mentalillnesses) one of the most common symptoms is #fatigue    Side notes: fatigue is NOT the same as feeling tired  in the same way that depression is NOT the same as feeling sad    fatigue can be awful 2/13,Sad
