"Why is this getting downvoted? He got the terms IDE and compiler mixed up, but it's still an excellent question. He wants to know if Sun makes an official IDE, like Microsoft does with their Express products.",Surprise

"I have done some research for ""The bast way to insert huge data into DB with C#"" then a lot of people just suggested me using SqlBulkCopy. After I tried it out and it really amazed me. Undoubtedly, SqlBulkCopy is very very fast. It seems that SqlBulkCopy is a perfect way to insert data (especially huge data). But why dont we use it at all times. Is there any drawback of using SqlBulkCopy?",Surprise
255 projects ! WOW ! well I can see that happening for what you do...,Surprise

I didn't know that. I always thought it was AND.,Surprise
"@Gary it is indeed strange enough that `Files` does not have a recursive deletion method... That sounds like an obvious thing to have. But it probably isn't. How to deal with errors, for instance…",Surprise
"I'm curious, shouldn't the other question be marked as a duplicate of this one? This question is two years older and has a higher rated answer.",Surprise
This one does not: Why is that?,Surprise
This is really weird. But a great question you posted! Nice to read. Here could be a solution: http://stackoverflow.com/a/3277996/1320237Why would it be impossible to import the Calltips module from the standart library? Maybe you have a Python 3 idle open? Then they interfere?,Surprise

"Why? Can¬¥t return $ -1.885,00?",Surprise
its a very weird behaviour!,Surprise
"Whoops, just realized something...there's no way for me to specify a max length when using String.String(sbyte*) which basically means death to using the constructor for the purpose of reading out of a ring-buffer since it could keep reading past the max length into the next segment!",Surprise
huh...it will be very great if modal case working in my situation!!! I can't find any example in network of this realization!!!,Surprise

OMG I hope that isn't all in one file!,Surprise
"that's what I thought, that's why I'm surprised",Surprise
I'm surprised nobody has encountered this issue before. It seems very painful for any medium sized project and must be horrible for larger projects.,Surprise
@IanNewson Whoops.. I didn't see your answer.. I just replied to this question as I have faced the same problem before. Also the answer to the question is a very general one.. there is nothing to copy here.. It is not fair to downvote my answer.. hope you understand!! Cheers :),Surprise
"We're running into a really painful issue with Honeycomb's here, and I was wondering if anyone else has found a solution. The problem itself is quite simple: We frequently trigger background tasks in Activity or , since most of our screens must display data loaded from a Web service. While these tasks are running, we show the ActionBar's refresh spinner and animate it. The problem is: onCreate and onResume are executed before is, so at the point where we start the task, the refresh spinner doesn't even exist. Hence, it won't animate. I don't see any simple way around this. I guess we could keep the information about a task being spawned in onCreate, and as soon as the ActionBar becomes available, update it accordingly. But still, I can't believe a use case as common as this is so difficult to do with ActionBar?",Surprise
Could you break this down for me? This looks scary :O,Surprise

"My work just gave me a quad core computer, and WOW build times are fast! (What used to take 20+ minutes now takes 7 minutes). Anyway, Visual Studio builds project in parallel (great for build times), but scrambles the output: Is there a plugin that sorts the output when the build is complete?",Surprise
"Oh, bummer, I think i got i right now?",Surprise
"Is your test case exhibiting this behavior in jsfiddle? I have tried it in Firefox, Chrome and Safari and do not see the shrinking you're talking about, although Chrome and Safari force a left-margin indent while dragging. (???) &#xA;&#xA;",Surprise
"Wow! Yeah, I did'nt know that! Great new feature.",Surprise
